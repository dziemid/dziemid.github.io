    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Ah-Counter is responsible for noting and keeping track of words and sounds used as a ‘crutch’ or
‘pause filler’ by anyone who speaks during the <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/Members/MemberExperience/MeetingRoles/Ahcounter.aspx">Toastmasters meeting</a>. Words may be inappropriate interjections such
as <em>and</em>, <em>well</em>, <em>but</em>, <em>so</em>, <em>like</em>, <em>you know</em>. Sounds may be <em>ah</em>, <em>um</em>, <em>er</em>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p></p>

<p>If you are a speaker, at the end of the meeting Ah-Counter will tell you how many times he caught you making inappropriate interjections, for example:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>&hellip;<br/>Greg &ndash; 7 times.<br/>Mark &ndash; only 1 time.<br/>&hellip;</p><footer><strong>Ah-Counter</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>This always leaves me wondering: &ldquo;When exactly do I make those sounds?&rdquo;. Reports like this are delivered too late, after I had already finished speaking.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen clubs solve this problem &ndash; Ah-Counter has a ring and uses it anytime he catches you. &ldquo;Ding!&rdquo; and immediately you are reminded to stop making &ldquo;um&rdquo;.</p>

<p>My current assignment is to get a dinging device for my club &ndash;
<a href="http://easy-speak.org/clubdata.php?c=4566"onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://easy-speak.org/clubdata.php?c=4566'); return false;"> Docklands Toastmasters</a>. I&rsquo;ve spent some time today going around shops looking for something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/tablebell.jpg" alt="bell" /></p>

<p>but I couldn&rsquo;t find any&hellip; So instead I&rsquo;ve made an app ;)</p>

<p>You can get <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=agilesurfing.pl.dingingahcounter"onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=agilesurfing.pl.dingingahcounter'); return false;"> Dinging Ah-Counter Android App for free  </a> here.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am working again on my goals. I want to be focused and work on the most important things.</p>

<p>In this short post I will share some of the things I have been doing to get myself on the right track again.</p>

<!--more-->


<p></p>

<h2>What should I work on?</h2>

<p>This is maybe the most difficult question, but once you get it figured out everything else becomes easier.</p>

<p>In the past I used following system with good results:</p>

<ul>
<li>What do I want to be true when I am 40?</li>
<li>Great, what needs to happen than before I am 30?</li>
<li>And what should I do this year?</li>
</ul>


<p>Recently, I have been introduced by <a href="https://twitter.com/gigantiqandy">Andy</a> to intermediate objective maps. They complement the system I&rsquo;ve been using, by visualising it nicely. I&rsquo;ve created small little tool for myself to make <a href="http://gregdmd.com/iom">creation of intermediate objective maps</a>
 easier.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://s3.postimg.org/jbjh5nx03/Screen_Shot_2014_05_25_at_5_24_13_pm.png">http://s3.postimg.org/jbjh5nx03/Screen_Shot_2014_05_25_at_5_24_13_pm.png</a>"></p>

<p> Check it out and let me know what you think.</p>

<p> The best tip Andy gave me was to share my map with my peers and get feedback. I am going to implement this advice soon :)</p>

<p> As a bonus, few weeks back I was wondering how much time actually I have before I am 30, hence this little tool, <a href="http://gregdmd.com/dob">the age calculator</a>.</p>

<h2>What should I work on this week?</h2>

<p>To visualise what I am working on at the moment (and where my attention should be) I&rsquo;ve started using recently <a href="http://trello.com">virtual board</a> provided by Trello.</p>

<p>At the moment my personal kanban board has following columns: &ldquo;Thinking about&rdquo;, &ldquo;To do&rdquo;, &ldquo;Doing&rdquo;, &ldquo;Waiting / Tracking&rdquo; and &ldquo;Done&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://s30.postimg.org/qygzfyhtt/Screen_Shot_2014_05_25_at_5_27_28_pm.png">http://s30.postimg.org/qygzfyhtt/Screen_Shot_2014_05_25_at_5_27_28_pm.png</a>"></p>

<p>I am experimenting with the on-line tool for this, as it gives me a lot of flexibility. Trello has a good mobile client and nice web UI.</p>

<h2>What should I work on next week?</h2>

<p>During a normal week I have heaps of interesting thoughts. They are inspired by conversation I have, tweets &amp; blogs I skim over, etc. It&rsquo;s quite easy to move on and forget about them.</p>

<p>To avoid this, I am capturing all those little thoughts and ideas in my &ldquo;Inbox&rdquo; <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> notebook. Every Saturday I go through my &ldquo;Inbox&rdquo; and I triage the notes. This gives me a chance to action some of them, or at least plan what to do next.</p>

<p>Evernote again is great for this, as it has easy to use mobile client that doesn&rsquo;t get in the way. For triage, Evernote desktop client is efficient and enjoyable to work with.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hope you are inspired to try some of these ideas out. What tools and techniques are you using to stay focused?</p>
