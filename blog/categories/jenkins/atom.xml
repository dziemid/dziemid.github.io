<p>Unless your Jenkins project just stopped building with this exception <code>hudson.plugins.git.GitException: Failed to fetch from git@github.com</code> you are unlikely to get much of this post ;)</p>

<p>I guess there might be bunch of the reasons why you could see this message, but here is what happend to me..</p>

<!--more-->


<p></p>

<p>My project hosted on github suddenly started to fail when building in jenkins. Initially I had no clue why and I&rsquo;ve done bunch of google searches:</p>

<p><code>
 jenkins github returned status code 128:
 jenkins ssh keys github stoped working
 "hudson.plugins.git.GitException: Failed to fetch from git@github.com"
</code></p>

<h2>Investigation</h2>

<p>Thinking a little bit more about my situation. We have a Jenkins that is connecting to GitHub using different ssh keys depending on project (<a href="https://developer.github.com/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys">deploy key approach</a> ). So I continued to google:</p>

<p><code>
 jenkins multiple ssh keys not working
 ssh debug which key git is using
</code></p>

<p>That led me to additional debugging commands: <code>ssh -vvvT git@github.com</code> and adding in <code>~/.ssh/config</code></p>

<p>```
  Host github.com</p>

<pre><code>LogLevel DEBUG3
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>While checking out projects from github and looking and debugging output problem became quite clear. Git, while using SSH, was authenticating using incorrect ssh key.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>In the end, what happend was that previous day I&rsquo;ve replaced <code>~/.ssh/config</code> on Jenkins box. Among other things, there was a problematic bit of config:</p>

<p><code>
Host *
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath /tmp/ssh_mux_%h_%p_%r
  ControlPersist 10m   # - this was causing issues
</code></p>

<blockquote><p>ControlPersist &ndash;  that automatically
  starts a background ssh(1) multiplex master when connecting. This
  connection can <strong>stay alive indefinitely</strong>, or can be set to
  automatically close after a user-specified duration of inactivity</p></blockquote>

<p>Above configuration was causing issues, when different projects were being build on Jenkins that were meant to use different ssh keys (while talking to github).</p>

<p>Removing above config solved the problem.</p>
