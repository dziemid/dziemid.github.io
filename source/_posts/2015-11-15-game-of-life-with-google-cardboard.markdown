## What is it?

It's pretty much in the name :-) Have a look at screenshot to get an idea of what it is.

What is special about this "Game of life" is, that you get to experience it in Virtual Reality, giving you a new, unique perspective.

You can learn [more about Cardboard here](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/) and read about [Game of life on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## How is it made?

The app is made using [Unity 5](https://unity3d.com/). I've started learning Unity recently and I am impressed how easy it's to get started. They have good tutorials that get you going and assets store full of things you can use in your apps.

It's really simple implementation written in C#, using [SDK](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/).

## What's next?

I've seen a great qoute on VR sometime ago:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Virtual Reality is BY FAR the biggest delta I&#39;ve ever seen between what it looks like from the outside vs what it feels like on the inside.</p>&mdash; Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/658479467296264192">October 26, 2015</a></blockquote>

I agree, and what it means is that you really need to get your hands on a Cardboard and try out the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.agilesurfing.gol"onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.agilesurfing.gol'); return false;">Game of Life for yourself.</a> :-)
