First of all, I will be honest with you with you... Refactoring Code Retreat is just more fancy name for a good old [Legacy Code Retreat](http://legacycoderetreat.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/how-i-run-legacy-code-retreat.html). 

Why use different name? After the last internal Code Retreat we speculated that the "legacy" was a put off for some people, that would otherwise enjoy the event:

{% blockquote Developer %}
Legacy code during weekend? I see enough of that during the week!
{% endblockquote %} 

So this time, we are changing the name, trying to make it more attractive ;)

Anyway, why should you attend? In my opinion, Legacy(Refactoring) Code Retreat is worth your time because:

<!--more--> 
  
  * **Pair programming** - You get to pair with other passionate devs. In fact at least 5 different ones during the day. How many new tricks can you learn?
  * **Getting better with Legacy Code** - Have you ever had to change legacy code without any tests? During Code Retreat you will practice techniques to put such a legacy code under tests. It's a chance to practice some of the ideas from [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131177052/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0131177052&linkCode=as2&tag=gregdziesblog-20&linkId=U6WOCUN4QHGJU2V7) book.
  * **Fun** - We are going to work with [legacy code](https://github.com/jbrains/trivia) that is actually nice. It is specifically crafted to by well suited for a CodeRetreat and it provides good training ground for applying techniques we want to master.
