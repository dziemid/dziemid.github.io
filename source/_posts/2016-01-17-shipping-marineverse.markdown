With the start of 2016 I've started working on a new project. [MarineVerse - all about sailing in virtual reality](http://www.marineverse.com). I am having quite a bit of fun working on it, combining my passion for sailing and technology.

I am working on MarineVerse together with Olga, with a great result. For example, check out the awesome logo :-)

Currently I am using Unity to build simple cardboard apps and also experimenting with GearVR. Below you can see me showing an early version of "[Point of Sail](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marineverse.pointofsail)" app.

Also, finally I've signed up to a sailing club in Melbourne and with a start of Feburary I will be joining a sailing course. Looking forward to it :-)

Coming back to MarineVerse, I am working on it with full steam ahead. There is a [landing page](http://www.marineverse.com) and [blog](http://blog.marineverse.com).

Please [follow MarineVerse](https://twitter.com/MarineVerseVR) on twitter and [like it on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MarineVerse/). Cheers :-)
