I've been introduced to one to one team feedback by Pat Kua in 2011. To this date, it's one of my favourited practices in an agile project *( I recommend Pat's blog post series you can find [here](https://www.thekua.com/atwork/2009/10/a-guide-to-receiving-feedback-part-i-ask-for-it/) )*.

During last 12 months or so, I was luckly enough to work in a team that was interested and happy to practice it. Also, teams around me were curious about it and I've run a few introductory sessions.

Together with Ilya, I've written up a short blog post explaining a little bit why and how we have been practicing it. You can find the [blog post here](http://techblog.realestate.com.au/one-to-one-feedback-at-rea/).
