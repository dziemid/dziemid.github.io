I've launched my new pet project HeCoSiRe and you can be part of it ;)

So what is it about?

**Functionally**, the vision is to have a platform to track how you feel and generate insights into your health.

*Adults get an average of two to four colds per year([source](http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/influenza/in-depth-resources/facts-about-the-common-cold.html))*
I've got mine over the x-mas break. Not fun, but a good motivation for a pet project.

From **technology** point of view, it's just an excuse to learn more about tools involved (*Android, Rails and machine learning + more?*).

So how can you get involved?

## Interested in learning about your health?

You can help by just getting on board, using the tool and providing feedback.

It's early days, but you can already easily capture how you feel. Over time I plan to add features around
analysing the data. Maybe one day HeCoSiRe will be able to notice:
*every time you start feeling sick and you eat a lemon you actually don't get sick*.

There is [a website hecosire.com](http://hecosire.com/) where you can create an account.

You can also get an [Android HeCoSiReApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hecosire.com.hecosireapp).

Last but not least, there is a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hecosire) and [Trello](https://trello.com/b/iw8dxU8A/hecosire) if you want to interact about the product.

## Interested about technology?

It's a pet project and as much as I am interested in the product I also want to learn how to use tools involved.

For example I am new to Android and I'm building an Android app. I am sure the way it's done at the moment it's not the best way to do it.
Overtime I hope to learn and improve, but in the meantime feedback and pull requests are welcomed.

Yes - HeCoSiRe is open source, you can find it on [HeCoSiRe github](https://github.com/hecosire/).

This also means, that if there is a feature you would like to see in HeCoSiRe, you can add it ;)

## Summary

*HeCoSiRe - what a strange name?* Yes I know, I needed something quickly for my "rails new" ;) It's from "**He**althy, **Co**ming down, **Si**ck and **Re**covering" cycle that I decided to use in the app.

If you are reading this, next step is to [create a HeCoSiRe account](http://hecosire.com/users/sign_up) and start tracking :)
