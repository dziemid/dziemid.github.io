The Ah-Counter is responsible for noting and keeping track of words and sounds used as a ‘crutch’ or 
‘pause filler’ by anyone who speaks during the [Toastmasters meeting](http://www.toastmasters.org/Members/MemberExperience/MeetingRoles/Ahcounter.aspx). Words may be inappropriate interjections such 
as *and*, *well*, *but*, *so*, *like*, *you know*. Sounds may be *ah*, *um*, *er*. 

<!--more--> 

If you are a speaker, at the end of the meeting Ah-Counter will tell you how many times he caught you making inappropriate interjections, for example:

{% blockquote Ah-Counter %}
...
Greg - 7 times.
Mark - only 1 time.
...
{% endblockquote %}

This always leaves me wondering: "When exactly do I make those sounds?". Reports like this are delivered too late, after I had already finished speaking. 

I've seen clubs solve this problem - Ah-Counter has a ring and uses it anytime he catches you. "Ding!" and immediately you are reminded to stop making "um". 

My current assignment is to get a dinging device for my club -

but I couldn't find any... So instead I've made an app ;)
